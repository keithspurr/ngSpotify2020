<h1>About ngSpotify</h1>
<h3>Version: 2.0</h3>
<p>ngSpotify Version 2 uses Angular version 6.</p>
<p>The Spotify Web API went private in 2016.</p>
<p>
  This ngSpotify update utilizes the now private Spotify Web API to find bands by name, and
  musicians by name, and displays albums and track listings. There are three search levels beginning with clicking on a query search result. The third level also gives track previews. Enjoy!
